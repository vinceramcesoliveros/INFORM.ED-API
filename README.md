## :rotating_light: Notice!

> This is still in-progress, and is not ready for beta phase yet. There are missing tables and api documentations needed to write up before deploying it to other service providers.

## :thinking: Why?

To make integration easier than to create a dummy frontend data. Nest Js proves to be more productive and scalable with the tools built in to it. The framework embraces architecture such as:

- ♻ [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)(Default)
- 🎯 [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
- 🧪[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
- 🦠[Microservices](https://microservices.io/).
  > The goal of the project is to make the implementation flexible and easy to set-up
